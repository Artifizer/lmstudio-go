# LM Studio Go

A Go library and CLI for interacting with [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/), inspired by [lmstudio-python](https://github.com/lmstudio-ai/lmstudio-client-python).


## Motivation

LM Studio is a great tool for interacting with LLMs and it has REST API for chatting, models management and more. However, this API is incomplete and is still in Beta, for example it doesn't yet support:

- Advanced model details (size, path, etc)
- Model loading and unloading progress
- Server management (start, stop, etc)
